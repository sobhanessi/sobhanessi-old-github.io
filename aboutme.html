    Few facts aboutme :
  </h1>
  <h3 class="headingaboutmepage">
    The beginnig :
  </h3>
  <p class="paragraphaboutmepage">
    I born on November 27th, 1994 in Tehran, Iran.<br>
    Born in a completely political family and I think that made me to want freedom for my country and my people. My family is in the opposition side to the Islamic terrorists who are governing my country, and because of that we were (and are) always banned to be with people and say our believes freely! We are under sword of government to do not do something that government doesn't want it to happen.
  </p>
  <h3 class="headingaboutmepage">
    Kid Age :
  </h3>
  <p class="paragraphaboutmepage">
    Since the beginnig, I was passion in Computers.<br>
    I remmember when I was 5, my uncle bought a computer and that time there was no Linux or Macintosh throught the country and computers were so expensive, I remmember that it was Dos based computer which my cousins and I used to work with that but actually them. I was not in the age to undestand what's going on! and after a while Windows 95 came on Floppy Disks which we could work that and paint somwthing in computer and even play that.
    Since I was 6, I didn't have my own computer.
    Meanwhile, I remmember in 1378, people of Tehran protested to achieve something. I couldn't judge them, but that was interesting for me to see people are protesting and making fire and throwing it to the polices.
    Anyway, this movement have calmed and we couldn't achieve anything and too many died.
  </p>
  <h3 class="headingaboutmepage">
    From 6 to 13 :
  </h3>
  <p class="paragraphaboutmepage">
    After that my father bought a computer, it seems that I'm in heaven because I could do too many things.<br>
    My first computer was running Windows 98 and its specs was Intel Pentium with 533 Mhz cpu and 128 MB of Ram and less than 1GB of hard drive and a CDROM and of course a Floppy Disk. But the most amazing was that, when we turned off the computer it went to halt but it didn't turned off completely we had to manually push the power button to completely turn it off :))<br>
    I learnt computer by destroying it and learn how to repair it without telling anyone that I destroyed this, which sometimes I put myself on a trouble because in Iran we had no iternet and there was no google same as now and I had to tell them that I ruined it which my uncle always fixed it for me.<br>
    The first thing I learnt was how to install Windows after completely ruining the computer and no clue or chance to repair it :))<br>
    My most mistake was that I didn't go to any kind of programming classes and it comes from that I have Strabism and Astikmatism very badly and I surgered my eyes twice until I was 12 and this issue put my family in a situation that didn't even let me to work with computers with more than two hours a day and there weren't any educated person in my family to guide me how to use the computer and what is the programming.<br>
    Anyway.<br>
    Meanwhile, I became gamer especially in soccer games such as Fifa or Pes.<br>
    And suddenly, in Nowrouz of 1383 the most important thing in my life happend. Which was we went to Ashraf, camp of Mojahedin-e Khalgh.<br>
    As I told you, I wasn't in the age to recongnize and analyze what is happening but I could recongnize a little bit about goods and bads around me which made me very political criticezer in my age which confidently can say 99% of my ages couldn't understand it.<br>
    I wasn't good enough to be always the best student especially in high school!<br>
    In 1385, my father arrested by Iran's Savak and sentenced him to five years in prison.<br>
    That time, that case was like a dagger on the back of me and shed light on my mind.<br>
    I believe that God will choose his humans to follow his instructions and distribute it to every where. I found that I am choosen. Because in 13, I could understand too many things in politics and wanted to bring freedom to my country. I couldn't hear and bear the bullshits that my teachers told in the classes.<br>
    I must mention that I have a very good memory from the journey that I had to Ashraf because I learnt too many things from them. And it is always like a tale for me.<br>

  </p>
  <h3 class="headingaboutmepage">
    From 14 to 18:
  </h3>
  <p class="paragraphaboutmepage">
    My father after almost a year in prison he came out for dismiss, and the state of country was almost calm so he could extend his dismissing to being in prison, and he registered to a computer class because he was seeing that I am very passion in computers. The class was ICDL. Class didn't go the way I expected and wanted because that taught me things and wasn't useful for me. And because of I couldn't pass my second exam in ICDL my father was unfortunately discouraged to register me in other classes and in the class I became familliar with Front-End with HTML which right now, I see it was my mistake and I didn't insist to register me to that class which if and only if I could go, I might be another person and even in a better situation, but past is past and I have to look forward for the future that waits for me.<br>
    Despite the ups and downs in my life I didn't lose my faith.<br>
    After I finished my secondary school, I went to the most Islamic school and my most ideas comes from that time.<br>
    High school was the most all bad time of my life.<br>
    I couldn't even practice my lessons because my taught was full of idea and I couldn't do anything.<br>
    That time I was limited even from my family.<br>
    In 2009, people of Iran went to the streets and there were huge protests that held in 2009 and 2010, and I was seeing them and I couldn't control myself. I could see how government are killing people and ruining our life and minimum of democracy.<br>
    Meanwhile my father arrested again and his absence took 3 years.<br>
    I had to go Gohardasht Prison alone to see my father for a 15 minutes per two week and they couldn't make a call because theye were banned!<br>
    My Strabismus came back, I saw everything almost two and I didn't care about that and my level in high school came down. What I can say is everything was in its bad way unfortunately and I was careless about my courses and my life but as I told you my most ideas come from that age in high school because I could recognize myself and make a goal for myself and ofcourse a roadmap.<br>
    I couldn't admit to a good University because I didn't educate very well and a good University was not a goal for my life but the page of my new life have begun from after my 18 years old.<br>
    I learnt too many things from my grandmother who was very courge and we went too many protests together in 2009 and 2010.<br>
    And of course she was one of them who shaped my thoughts and encouraged and pushed me to this way and I'm so happy.<br>

    </p>

    <h3 class="headingaboutmepage">
      University and Beyond :
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraphaboutmepage">
      I was admitted to the University, and again my most mistake was heared my parents advices to not to go to Computer field.<br>
      I choose Survey Engineering at IAUSTB.<br>
      But I was still in passion of Computers so I decide to go classes out of the University.<br>
      I went to CCNA and CCNP classes which was great courses and I learnt too many things.<br>
      But I couldn't find a job in that field. After a while I could find a job in computer field and everything was going fine untill I found out that I am too back in my courses in University and I resigned the job and I couldn't figure out my things in Survey Engineering so I decided that THIS IS THE TIME THAT I MUST GO ON MY WAY.<br>
      I changed my field of study from Survey to Hardware Engineering.<br>
      Not everything, but most of them were going pretty well.<br>
      I was passion in Hardware Engineering, I searched everything from that in the internet and learnt too many things<br>
      I myself learnt a little about Front-End in HTML and CSS which you can see my website built by me. <br>
      In December 25th,2016 I arrested by Iran's Savak who arrested my father years ago!<br>
      That was very bad.<br>
      They wanted to shut me.<br>
      They arrested my mother too to make a confess from me and put me and bad situation.<br>
      I won't forget that night.<br>
      I found myself in cell in 209 in Evin.<br>
      everything passed like a wind and I thought that it's a dream.<br>
      After a month in cell, they freed me. They freed my mother two or three days after we have arrested and they brought everything they wanted and made a confession the way that they wanted.<br>
      After three months I sentenced for 7 years in prison!<br>
      In September I chose not to stay in Iran anymore.<br>
      So I escaped from Iran.<br>
      And right now I'm looking forward for many things. The things I have learnt by myself made my advantages.<br>
      I'm learning too many things right now.<br>
      I couldn't bring my laptop from Iran but I could buy a Raspberry Pi and work with that.<br>
      I could almost finish my website's front-end and finished learning Python and I'm trying too finish LPIC-1 course beside learning SQL and web development and how to make web applications on CS50W course in Edx from Harvard University.<br>
      <br>
      MY STORY HASN'T FINISHED YET. THIS IS JUST A BEGINNIG OF MY LIFE AND I WANT TO MAKE A WORLD SLIGHTLY BETTER PLACE FOR EVERYONE.
