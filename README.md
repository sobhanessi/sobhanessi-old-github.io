www.sobhanesfandiari.com website

Hello, My name is Sobhan Esfandyari from Iran.
I've been working on my website since Jan. and I decided to take Harvard course's in Edx and
made some changes for your Project0.

I've added two Bootstrap's 4 Grids in Wikiplus and News page.
You can find Bootstrap component in Contact page.
I only could make scss file for Wikiplus page with only one variable,nesting and inheritance.
and this is because my final website is almost done except its backend.
all pages are linked to each other.
there are too many images in news page and politics page. even in about me page.
there are too man css selectors in each stylesheets.
you will find table in a news about intel's cpu.
you can find my list in about me page.
also I published my website in the internet: sobhanesfandiari.com


new : I gave up grid bootstraps because of issues that I couldn't solve it,
but I wrote those codes by myself which my website work perfectly and fine.
